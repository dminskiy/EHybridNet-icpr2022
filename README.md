# Efficient Hybrid Network: Inducting Scattering Features

This repository presents an implementation of the E-HybridNet.

The paper describing the network's architecture, properties and performance was presented at ICRP-2022 and published in the conference proceedings: [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9956176).

The content will be updated soon.
In the meantime, I happy to take questions and queries at d.minskiy@surrey.ac.uk
