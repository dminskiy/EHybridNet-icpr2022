# Efficient Hybrid Network: Inducting Scattering Features

This repository presents the author's implementation of the E-HybridNet.

The paper describing the network's architecture, properties and performance was presented at ICRP-2022 and published in the conference proceedings: [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9956176).

The latest implementation of the E-Hybrid Net is available as a part of another project: [link](https://sites.google.com/view/hpa-hcpl)

Note, due to the project specific requirements it'll ask you to fill in a form before the code can be shared.

I'm working on updating the E-Hybrid Net code to share here soon. Please, feel free to reach out to me in the meantime at minskiyda@gmail.com
